GET,/connectors/(string:name),Get information about the connector.
GET,/connectors/(string:name)/config,Get the configuration for the connector.

GET,/connectors/(string:name)/status,"Gets the current status of the connector, including:"
POST,/connectors/(string:name)/restart,"Restart the connector. You may use the following query parameters to restart
any combination of the Connector and/or Task instances for the connector."
PUT,/connectors/(string:name)/pause,"Pause the connector and its tasks, which stops message processing until the connector is resumed.
This call asynchronous and the tasks will not transition to PAUSED state at the same time."
PUT,/connectors/(string:name)/resume,"Resume a paused connector or do nothing if the connector is not paused.
This call asynchronous and the tasks will not transition to RUNNING state at the same time."
DELETE,/connectors/(string:name)/,"Delete a connector, halting all tasks and deleting its configuration. Return 409 (Conflict)

POST,/connectors/(string:name)/tasks/(int:taskid)/restart,Restart an individual task.
GET,/connectors/(string:name)/topics,"Returns a list of connector topic names. There is no defined order in which the topics are returned and consecutive calls may return the same topic names but in different order.

PUT,/connectors/(string:name)/topics/reset,Resets the set of topic names that the connector has been using since its creation or since the last time its set of active topics was reset.
GET,/connector-plugins/,"Return a list of connector plugins installed in the Kafka Connect cluster.
Note that the API only checks for connectors on the worker that handles the
request, which means you might see inconsistent results (especially during a
rolling upgrade if you add new connector jars)."
PUT,/connector-plugins/(string:name)/config/validate,"Validate the provided configuration values against the configuration definition. This API
performs per config validation, returns suggested values and error messages during validation."
